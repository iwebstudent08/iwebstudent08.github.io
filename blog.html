                <h3>Week 1</h3>
                <div class="date">06/14/2019</div>
                <p>Week one was the most hardest week because of all of stuff we had to do and the errors we came
                    through.
                    I first learned how to host a website using github. Github is a website that will host your website
                    for FREE!
                    Then we had to use terminal to create a html file which we will be using to create our website.
                    After we created our website we
                    started coding right away, but some people got some problems with their html file but luckly I
                    wasn't one of them. After the week was over I finished my home page
                    and made 3 sections on what I like to do I the Summer.</p>

                <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <div class="date">06/21/2019</div>
                <p>This week I created my sub pages. In order to do this I had to do a save as on my index file so I can
                    have a copy of it
                    Then I renamed the save as file to about.html so that I can have a about page. After I created my
                    about page I coded it how I did with my home page.Because I didnt have a
                    blog page I had to make one, but how? I copyed my about page as a save as file. Then name the file
                    blog.html. After I made the file I started coding it and started making a blog post like what im
                    doing right now.</p>

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <div class="date">06/28/2019</div>
                <p>This week we got into abobe XD and abobe photoshop and illustrator. We also made a custem logo
                    for fun using abobe photoshop which was really cool because we cleaned up the photo and made
                    it look like a purfect picture. Than we did abobe photoshop which was a fast and easy way to
                    design our websites to be awesome. If you want to see mt abobe XD it will be in the about page
                    under my personal links.

                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <div class="date">07/05/19</div>
                <p>This week we created a Abobe XD prototype to experament on designing websites.In my Abobe XD
                    prototype I made custom logo using Lines,colors,and shapes. But the think about Abobe XD is
                    that it's just desiging not coding and you whatever you design you cant get the code for it.
                    If you want to see my awesome Abobe XD click on this link ---> <a
